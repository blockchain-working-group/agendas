## B) Next actions (at least 3)
- **Lock speakers & demos:** Confirm ZKP demo owner (#34) and AI Mindsystems presenter (#31) by Feb 18; collect slides/abstracts the Monday before each session.
- **Issue-to-agenda mapping:** Add the issue IDs beside each agenda item in `README.md` and close the loop in GitHub with planned dates; re-label or close “stale” where appropriate (#24, #10).
- **Prep materials:** Drop 3–5 links per week into `RESOURCES.md` aligned to the five themes (ZKPs, VCs/DIDs, policy/controls, interop+AI, labs/tokenization) by Feb 19.
- **Working-in-the-open guardrails:** Draft a one-pager summarizing contribution norms and reference materials (#26) before the Mar 20 session.
- **Lab project intake:** Spin up a shared sheet for potential lab projects (#23) capturing scope, data sensitivity, success criteria by Mar 5.

## C) Creative / constructive ideas
- **Lightning-round “show & tells”:** Allow any member 2 minutes to demo a repo, dashboard, or policy memo; cap at 4 per session to keep pace.
- **Mini-surveys live in-meeting:** Use one 3-question poll each week to capture sentiment (e.g., “Which interop standard should we prototype first?”); publish results in the minutes.
- **Rotating scribe + action owners:** Rotate note-takers so every organization contributes; track action owners and due dates in the agenda doc itself.
- **Quarterly demo day:** Every quarter, replace one session with 3–4 demos of tangible artifacts (code, data pipelines, compliance templates) and invite adjacent ACT-IAC groups to cross-pollinate.
- **“Sandbox hour” follow-up:** Offer an optional 30-minute open lab after the main call once a month where contributors can pair on PRs or issue grooming.
